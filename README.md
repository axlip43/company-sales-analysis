## Website 
I created it an HTML/CSS website to help visualise the data analysis of the company , i also added some modifictaions :
-".nojekyll" empty file : as there was an error uploading the website on git hub , and this immediately fixed it .
-"company_database.zip": on the website , the company database.sql was not an allowed downloadable , so the best solution is to convert it to a zip file , rename it  (company_database.zip)  and add it to the folder /docs.
